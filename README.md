Graph Data Structure - Python
=============================

Overview
--------
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of
vertices (nodes) and edges (connections).

Graphs can be:
- Directed or Undirected
- Weighted or Unweighted
- Cyclic or Acyclic

Representation
--------------
This implementation uses an Adjacency List, which is
memory efficient and commonly used in real-world systems.

Traversals
----------
1. Breadth First Search (BFS)
   - Uses queue
   - Explores level by level

2. Depth First Search (DFS)
   - Uses recursion or stack
   - Explores depth first

Time Complexity
---------------
BFS: O(V + E)
DFS: O(V + E)

Space Complexity
----------------
O(V + E)

Advantages
----------
- Flexible structure
- Models real-world networks efficiently
- Supports advanced algorithms

Use Cases
---------
- Social networks
- Road and map systems
- Computer networks
- Recommendation systems
